# twidlr: data.frame-first formula-second modelling <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" />


## Overview

twidlr is an R package that exposes **data.frame-first formula-second** versions of modelling functions. All modelling functions exposed by twidlr are of the following format:

> model_function(data = data.frame, formula = y ~ x's, ...)

twidlr gets its name from the "tilde", often called a "twiddle", used in R formulas.

## Installation

twidlr is available to install from github by running:

```{r, eval = F}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("drsimonj/twidlr")
```

## Usage

`library(twidlr)` will expose modelling functions that you're already familiar with, but such that they accept a data frame, formula, and additional arguments!

For example, a typical linear model would be `lm(hp ~ mpg * wt, mtcars, ...)`. Once `twidlr` is loaded, the same model would be run via `lm(mtcars, hp ~ mpg * wt, ...)`.

## Motivation

- **Consistent API** for modelling functions (helping to improve the generality of tidy modelling packages like [piplearner](https://github.com/drsimonj/pipelearner))
- **[Tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/) philosophy** by working with data frames and being pipeable such as `mtcars %>% lm(hp ~ wt)`
- **Leverage formula operators** where they may be valid but not originally available. For example, to specify select variables or include additional terms like interactions and dummy-coded variables with syntax such as `glmnet(iris, Sepal.Width ~ Petal.Width * Petal.Length + Species)`.

## twidlr models

data.frame-first formula-second model functions exposed by twidlr:

```{r, echo = F}
x <- data.frame(rbind(
  c(Package = "stats", Function = "lm"),
  
  ## Add new model functions here as c("Package", "Function") ------ >
  
  c("xgboost", "xgboost"),
  c("glmnet", "glmnet"),
  c("stats", "glm"),
  c("rpart", "rpart"),
  c("randomForest", "randomForest"),
  c("lme4", "lmer"),
