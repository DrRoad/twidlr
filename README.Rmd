twidlr is an R package that exposes data.frame-first, formula-second, versions of modelling functions. All modelling functions exposed by twidlr are of the following format:

> model_function(data = data.frame, formula = y ~ ...)

twidlr gets its name from the "tilde", often called a "twiddle", used in R formulas.
